What is Gradle?
===============

Gradle is a standard build tool that is used for building and deploying primarily Java applications, but it can be used for any codebase. The full user guide for Gradle is available at http://www.gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/userguide.html. 

What is ml-gradle?
=========
ml-gradle is a [Gradle plugin](http://www.gradle.org/plugins "") that supports a number of tasks pertaining to deploying an application to MarkLogic and interacting with other features of MarkLogic via a Gradle build file. The bulk of the functionality provided by ml-gradle is actually in [ml-app-deployer](https://github.com/rjrudin/ml-app-deployer) - ml-gradle is just intended to be a thin wrapper around this library, exposing its functionality via Gradle tasks and properties.

Why use ml-gradle?
=========
ml-gradle is a good fit for you and your team if:

1. You're using MarkLogic 8
2. You're using Gradle, or you're considering moving away from Ant/Maven/etc to Gradle to manage all of your build processes
3. You'd like to use a build tool that can manage the dependencies and execution of MarkLogic tools such as the Java Client API, mlcp, corb, recordloader, xqsync
4. You'd like to have a single all-purpose tool that allows you to define tasks to do anything you need to on your MarkLogic project, including tasks that have nothing to do with MarkLogic. 

If you're currently using Ant or Maven and are wondering about Gradle, there are many comparisons of these tools on the Internet; I recommend making this shift. If you are using Ant, it's easy to invoke Ant tasks from Gradle. And if you can't move away from Maven, you can try [this Maven plugin for invoking Gradle](https://github.com/if6was9/gradle-maven-plugin).

What are the main features of ml-gradle?
=========
1. Utilizes the new [Management REST API](http://docs.marklogic.com/REST/management) in MarkLogic 8 to configure and deploy all aspects of an application.
1. Can watch for new/modified modules and automatically load them for you, thus speeding up the code/build/test cycle
1. Can run Content Pump, Corb, and other Java-based MarkLogic tools without having to copy jars around and worry about a classpath
1. Can treat packages of MarkLogic code as [true third-party dependencies](https://github.com/rjrudin/ml-gradle/wiki/Preparing-REST-API-dependencies), resolving them just like you would a dependency on a jar, as well as automatically loading such code into your modules database
1. Can take advantage of [all the features of Gradle](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/overview.html)

How can I start using ml-gradle?
=========
First, please note the [Wiki and FAQ](https://github.com/rjrudin/ml-gradle/wiki) which have answers to many of the questions you'll have or run into soon.

To use ml-gradle right away, you'll need Gradle installed first. And of course you'll need Marklogic installed somewhere - it doesn't have to be the same computer as the one you're running Gradle on. Then create a directory for your project and add a build.gradle file and a gradle.properties file (a Gradle best practice is to put properties in this file so they can be easily overridden). Here's the simplest build.gradle file possible:

    plugins {
      id "com.marklogic.ml-gradle" version "2.1.0"
    }

And here's a basic gradle.properties file (you can of course customize these properties as needed, particularly the port - make sure that it's open on the host you're deploying to; you can also omit all of these, and ml-gradle will assume some sensible defaults, but it's expected you'll want to customize these):

    mlHost=localhost
    mlUsername=admin
    mlPassword=admin
    mlAppName=quick-start
    mlRestPort=8200

Then just run "gradle mlDeploy" in the directory containing these two files (note that the first time you run this, Gradle
may need to download a number of dependencies):

    gradle mlDeploy
    
You'll end up with a new REST API server on port 8200 with a modules database and a content database with 3 forests by default. 

To see exactly what mlDeploy is doing, just run Gradle with the "-i" or "--info" option (it's normally useful to do this in any case with Gradle):

    gradle -i mlDeploy

And to see all the tasks available to you, just run:

    gradle tasks
    
You can also get a preview of those tasks at [the Wiki page on all tasks](https://github.com/rjrudin/ml-gradle/wiki/All-tasks).

Exploring the sample projects
-----

To start customizing your application, your best bet is to examine the [sample-project application](https://github.com/rjrudin/ml-gradle/blob/master/examples/sample-project) in this repository (along with all the other sample projects in that directory). There are three primary things to examine:

1. The [build.gradle file](https://github.com/rjrudin/ml-gradle/blob/master/examples/sample-project/build.gradle) provides examples of configuring and extending ml-gradle. 
1. The [ml-config directory](https://github.com/rjrudin/ml-gradle/tree/master/examples/sample-project/src/main/ml-config) provides examples of many of the MarkLogic management resources currently supported by ml-gradle.
1. The [ml-modules directory](https://github.com/rjrudin/ml-gradle/tree/master/examples/sample-project/src/main/ml-modules) provides examples of the different kinds of modules that can be loaded (application modules are loaded via the MarkLogic Client REST API, not the Management REST API). 

To try out the sample project, just do the following:

1. Clone this repository
1. cd examples/sample-project
1. gradle mlDeploy

For a new project - to quickly generate a useful set of configuration files, just run:

    gradle mlScaffold

This will generate a directory structure containing several configuration files - one for a content database, a REST API server, an application role, an application user, and more. You can change these and add more configuration files based on the examples in the sample project mentioned above.
